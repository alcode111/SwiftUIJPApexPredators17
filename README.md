## Description

JPApexPredatorApp17 is a SwiftUI application that showcases information about apex predators from different environments, including land, air, and sea.

## Features

- **List View**: Displays a list of apex predators with their images, names, and types.
- **Search**: Allows users to search for specific apex predators by name.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter apex predators by their types, such as land, air, or sea.
- **Detailed View**: Provides detailed information about each apex predator, including their name, image, habitat, movies they appear in, and related movie scenes.
- **Interactive Map**: Shows the locations of apex predators on a map with annotations. Tapping on an annotation displays additional information about the predator.
- **Dark Mode**: Supports both light and dark mode for better user experience.

## Stretch Goals

1. **Tappable Dinosaur Image**: Make the dinosaur image in the detailed view tappable to provide additional information or navigate to related content.
2. **Info Card for Annotations**: Add an info card that pops up when tapping on dinosaur annotations in the interactive map, displaying relevant details about the selected dinosaur.
3. **Filtering by Movie**: Implement filtering by movie option in the list view, allowing users to filter apex predators based on the movies they appear in.
4. **Permanent Removal of Dinosaurs**: Enable users to permanently remove a dinosaur from the list via a delete button or swipe action.
